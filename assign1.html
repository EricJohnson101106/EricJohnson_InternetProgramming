    Eric Johnson is currently enrolled at Kennesaw State University, KSU, and is expected to graduate in the Summer of
    2019. Eric has been attending KSU since Fall 2015 and has been working towards a Computer Science degree. Eric had
    graduated High School in Spring 2010 and has had a few hiccups on his journey to where he is today.
    He hopes to find employment at Pacific Northwest National Lab in Richland, WA following his graduation.
    Eric's birthday is March 25, 1992. His favorite color is purple. During his free time Eric enjoys playing video
    games with people he has met online. In addition to this, he enjoys researching things related the current game he
    is playing as well as discussing things with his friends; as such, he enjoys the process of planning and discussion
    as much as he enjoys the playing the games.
    <br><br> Eric understands he has much to learn before he'll make a high quality web page. For now though, this is
    Assignment 1
    for Internet Programming, CS 4720 at KSU Summer 2019 Semester.
